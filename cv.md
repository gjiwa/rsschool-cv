##About me##
I worked as an accountant for 6 years, in this time I became interested in web development, I was trying to make my own sites. Later I decided to try myself in programming and entered the *Saint-Petersburg Electrotechnical University ETU ‚ÄúLETI‚Äù*. But I haven't discovered much talent in programming, so I decided to do something else. I started to learn photography and retouching. I worked on studio as a retoucher, made photoshoots in my spare time. But recently I decided to give another try in web development. Because it is also the thing I like to do. Maybe I can work as a emplate designer. It would be interesting for me.
